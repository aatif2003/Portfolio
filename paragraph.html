        Eight people, including six children, have been trapped in a cable car dangling high above a ravine in Pakistan
        after a line snapped.<br>
        The children were using the chairlift to get to school when a cable broke at a height of around<br> 1,200 feet
        (about 365 metres) midway through its journey in a remote, mountainous part of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

        The former chairman of the NDMA says the chairlift incident was unique in the agency’s history.

        “This is the first time its happening,” Nadeem Ahmed told Al Jazeera. “There has not been a time when the army
        aviation has been deployed to take out people from a chairlift.”
